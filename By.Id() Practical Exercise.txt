Bonus:
What locator could you use to locate all elements on the page that have an id using the dev tools console?
    Answer: You would use a CSS selector to find all elements with the attribute id, in addition I had to use document.querySelectorAll() method
            in order to return a list of nodes that contain an id. A shorter version uses $$("[id]")
               document.querySelectorAll("[id]")
               $$("[id]")
